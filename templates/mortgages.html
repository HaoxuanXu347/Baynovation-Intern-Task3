        <h2>Fixed-Rate Mortgage</h2>
        <p>A fixed-rate mortgage is a type of mortgage where the interest rate remains constant for the entire term
            of the loan. This provides borrowers with predictable monthly payments over the life of the loan.</p>

        <h2>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)</h2>
        <p>An adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, has an interest rate that can change periodically. Typically, an ARM
            starts with a lower initial rate that adjusts after a set period. Borrowers should be aware of potential
            rate fluctuations.</p>

        <h2>Interest-Only Mortgage</h2>
        <p>With an interest-only mortgage, borrowers only pay the interest on the loan for a specific period. After
            that, they start paying both principal and interest. It can offer lower initial payments but may result
            in a larger final payment.</p>

        <h2>Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loan</h2>
        <p>An FHA loan is a government-backed mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. It is designed
            to help low-to-moderate-income borrowers with lower down payments and more lenient credit requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>Veterans Affairs (VA) Loan</h2>
        <p>VA loans are available to eligible veterans, active-duty service members, and some members of the
            National Guard and Reserves. These loans typically require no down payment and offer favorable terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Jumbo Loan</h2>
        <p>A jumbo loan is a type of mortgage that exceeds the conforming loan limits set by government agencies.
            They are often used for high-priced properties and may have stricter qualification requirements.</p>
